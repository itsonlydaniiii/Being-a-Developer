# Being a Developer

While completing my learning with App Academy (Software Engineer) I was provided with much more than code to learn, there were numerous instances where I was provided with practical skills that would improve my mindset and abilities to succeed as a developer. 

Since I have been keeping my learning material notes central to GitHub, I decided to also include my notes on these skills on my GitHub as well to ensure I can refer back to them easily when needed.
