# How to learn to code
- taking the requirements from other team members and translating them into code
-  reqirements don't spell out the step-by-step process that the developer should take

# Wireframe and Specifications
- lightweight, rapidly developed design specs that outline the structure and layout of a web page
- might be as simple as a quick handdrawn sketch, or they might be so detailed they look just like a completed page
    - may also be given a list of specifications

# Translating Wireframes and Specifications into Code
- How should I organize the code? What files will I need to create or use to implement this project?
    - figure out the architecture, styles, and conventions that the team uses, and make sure you are following them as you contribute to the codebase
- What's the best way to organize the elements on the page?
    - need to map out which elements will be used for each piece of content on the page, and you will have to make decisions on how elements are grouped together. These decisions will be important when you start styling the page.
- How should I deal with the details that are not specified in the wireframe?
    - Many important details, such as the amount of whitespace between elements, will not be specified for you. You will need to do your best to make decisions that look similar to the wireframe, and are visually appealing.
- How will I make sure the page is responsive on multiple screen sizes?
    - This is an important detail on any project, as many wireframes include designs for a web and a mobile version. There might be content and organization differences between the two. It will be up to you to thoroughly test your page on multiple screen sizes to make sure everything looks and works as it should regardless of the screen size of the user.

# Using Experimentation and Problem-Solving to Get the Job Done
- Start with the most basic elements or placeholders
    - Review the main chunks of what the web page holds - nav bar, image and text layout or buttons - insert placeolders for these features to give you a general idea of what the page might look like and work up from there. 
- Experiment and Test
    - As you start honing in one section of the page, you will start focusing on more of the details. For example, you notice that in the web version above, the text section with "Change your career. Change your life" is left-justified on the web version, and centered on the mobile version. You'll notice the difference in line breaks between the two versions. You won't be given explicit step-by-step directions on how to account for this. To make this happen, you will need to start coding and experimenting, and check the output in the browser. You'll use the Chrome Developer Tools to test out what the heading and body text look like on different screen sizes. You might adjust your font size, margins, and padding until you get the effects you are looking for. You will keep experimenting and trying new approaches until your page matches the wireframe.
- Use Research and Documentation to Solve Specific Problems
    - No matter how experienced you are, you will always face challenges that are new to you and outside the scope of your training. When this happens, it is time do some research to learn new approaches and skills to solve the problem at hand.
    - Sometimes you will need to look at the documentation to learn new syntax; other times you might need to learn how to use a new library or tool that might help you solve the problem.
